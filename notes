After implementing base reflection API
Scrap switch and replace with reflection API and make a commit
Then replace reflection API with Spring and commit again

No two instructions can have the same label
Labels end with a colon but the colon is not part of the name
Adjacent fields of an instruction is separated by whitespace (is this space only?)

---
Labels.java
labels is a hashmap of <String, Integer> which is <label, address>
---
Registers.java
registers is a map of <Register, Integer>
Register is an enum.
---
Machine.java
initializes labels
initializes program which is a List<Instruction>
initializes registers

programCounter starts at 0

The execute method has a while loop (while programCounter < program.size())
This is the size of the List of Instructions
########
How does the machine get the List of Instructions?
########

Instructions return a NORMAL_PROGRAM_COUNTER_UPDATE integer which is set to -1
If the programCounterUpdate value is -1, then the programCounter increments by 1
And moves to the next Instruction (if there is any).

19/02/23 - help session notes:
null pointer exception is not that informative
deliver to the user a useful message
throw "not a null pointer exception, something else"
throw your exception class that contains useful message for user
null pointer indicates that dev code contains an error
in this case the input is unacceptable
so your code should check if the inputs are incorrect
give message and line number for the error that was caused

dont ignore erroneous code and continue
integration tests
