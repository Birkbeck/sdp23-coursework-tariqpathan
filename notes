After implementing base reflection API
Scrap switch and replace with reflection API and make a commit
Then replace reflection API with Spring and commit again

No two instructions can have the same label
Labels end with a colon but the colon is not part of the name
Adjacent fields of an instruction is separated by whitespace (is this space only?)

---
Labels.java
labels is a hashmap of <String, Integer> which is <label, address>
---
Registers.java
registers is a map of <Register, Integer>
Register is an enum.
---
Machine.java
initializes labels
initializes program which is a List<Instruction>
initializes registers

programCounter starts at 0

The execute method has a while loop (while programCounter < program.size())
This is the size of the List of Instructions
########
How does the machine get the List of Instructions?
########

Instructions return a NORMAL_PROGRAM_COUNTER_UPDATE integer which is set to -1
If the programCounterUpdate value is -1, then the programCounter increments by 1
And moves to the next Instruction (if there is any).
